# Book-search-engine

## Description 
This app is a book search engine that searches for books the user may be looking for and provides different types of
information on said book. A user is supposed to be able to signup and login and the user can then search for a book of thier 
choosing

## Usage
The assignment helped me understand the complexity of dealing with modifying existing RESTful API and converting it
into a GraphQl API. Learing to do this was not only hard on both the client or server side, but the deployment side. 
I learned to debug any errors I encountered and learn from my mistakes I made along the way, after all I was able to make this 
book search engine into something much more complex and effecient too.
